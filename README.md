## Methods & Techniques

- Followed the **CRISP-DM framework** for data mining
- Implemented and evaluated multiple unsupervised learning models:
  - **K-Means**
  - **Self-Organizing Maps (SOM)**
  - **DBSCAN**
- Considered **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)** for dimensionality reduction, but excluded to preserve interpretability
